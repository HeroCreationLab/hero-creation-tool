# Hero Creation Tool for Foundry VTT - DnD5e

## 1.0.1 (2021-07-28)
- Fixed compendium selection window resizing incorrectly and rendering some options hidden (#13).
- Corrected styling on Race/Class selector, and properly defaulting to Mystery Man icons when no other image found, as very infant preparation for DDB Importer integration.
- Fixed incorrect naming of tools on the select (#12).

## Release 1.0.0 (2021-07-28)
- First release
- Tokenizer integration available from release - Thanks MrPrimate for the support!
- Bug Reporter integration available from release too, for easier and better bug reporting.
- No validations done so far other than a character name is included. This was done on purpose, to give playgroups the flexibility they might need if they need to customize something.
